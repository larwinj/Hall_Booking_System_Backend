# Problem Statement (Customer view)

The process of booking halls for events such as meetings, conferences, or functions is
often time-consuming and inefficient when managed manually. Users have to physically visit
the venue to check availability, negotiate timings, and confirm bookings. This creates
inconvenience, miscommunication, and the risk of double bookings. To overcome these issues, a Hall Booking System is required that allows users to
conveniently view hall categories, check availability, book slots online, make secure
payments, and receive booking confirmations digitally. At the same time, the system should
provide administrators with tools to manage users, bookings, payments, and contact queries
efficiently.


Finding and booking the right hall for an event is stressful and slow.
Customers face scattered availability, surprise fees, delayed confirmations, and hard-to-manage reschedules or add-ons.

They want a simple, reliable way to search available halls, compare prices and extras, get instant confirmation, and change plans without friction.

Our system removes the hassle: unified availability, transparent pricing, instant booking, and easy self-service for changes and add-ons — all designed for busy people who need events to go smoothly.
